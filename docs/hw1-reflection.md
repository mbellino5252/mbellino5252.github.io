Prompts Used:
Initial Prompt: "Create a personal homepage with About Me, My Interests, and Contact sections. Include navigation links, images, and CSS. In horzontail postion."
Follow-up Prompt: "Add more colors to the page, such as background colors for sections and hover effects on links." 
I also copied and pasted section one to show what html tags and elments to use so it would stick to what we learned in class.
Strategy:
I started by asking the AI for a simple personal homepage. After getting the initial code, I asked for more color and hover effects to make the page more dynamic and engaging.

Follow-up Interactions:
I refined the design by requesting more color and hover effects. This made the page look more polished and user-friendly.

Code Comparison
My Version vs. AI Version:
My Version: Simple color scheme with minimal design, no hover effects or responsive layout.
AI Version: Used multiple colors, added hover effects, and made the page responsive for different screen sizes.
Significant Differences:
Color Scheme: AI used vibrant colors that made the page look more attractive. My version was more basic.
Interactivity: AI added hover effects, making links more interactive, which improved user experience.
Responsiveness: AI used media queries, making the page adjust to different screen sizes, while mine did not.
Achieving Similar Results with Basic Elements:
Without media queries, I could use fixed pixel values for layout, but it wouldnâ€™t be as flexible as the AI's design.

Learning Reflection
What I Learned:
AI's Approach: The AI added interactivity and color, making the page look modern. It also introduced me to responsive design, which ensures pages work well on all devices.
Challenges: Choosing the right colors and spacing was tricky. Also, making the navigation clear and easy to use took some adjustments.
Future Work:
I'll use hover effects and media queries more often to make websites interactive and mobile-friendly.
I'll pay more attention to color choices to create a balanced, professional look.
This experience taught me how to improve my designs with simple but effective features.
